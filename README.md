# README

I have really enjoyed the process of building things from scratch. I know everyone learns differently, but even if I still don't have certain parts memorized it definitely helps me understand the logical connections between every facet of the application.
I did not end up having enough time to build it twice last night, but I finished building full CRUD functionality for the libraries and began to implement the same for the users, which got me thikning about some more advanced validation methods. I was able to sucessfully deloy it to Heroku as well. 


This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
